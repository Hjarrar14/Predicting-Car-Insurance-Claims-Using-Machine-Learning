# Predicting Car Insurance Claims Using Machine Learning


## description
 Developed a predictive solution to forecast car insurance claims, improving risk assessment and pricing strategies.
 
-	Cleaned and preprocessed data with Pandas/NumPy to ensure high-quality inputs.
-	Engineered features and applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and overfitting control.
-	Built and tuned Random Forest and Neural Networks (Keras/TensorFlow), achieving 84% accuracy on test data.
-	Visualized feature importance and performed clustering (KMeans, silhouette score) to identify key risk factors and customer segments.
